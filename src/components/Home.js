                A material fact is one that is likely to influence an
                Underwriterâ€™s judgement and acceptance of your proposal. If your
                proposal is a renewal of an existing policy, it should also
                include any change in facts previously advised to Underwriters.
                If you are in any doubt as to whether or not facts are
                considered material, you should disclose them.
